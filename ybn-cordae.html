The rapper has released more than a few fantastic numbers for his entire fan base in the United States and beyond. He grew up in Suitland, Maryland and spent his childhood there.</p><p>The young boy began rapping and singing at a very young age. He got inspiration from other famous singers from the American rap industry. He took a good start by launching three exciting mixtapes with titles; I am So Anxious (2016), Anxiety (2014), and I am So Anonymous (2017). All these were well-received within the young circles. He had launched all three mixtapes before becoming an official member of YBN in 2018.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/world-celebs.com/public/media/resize/800x-/2019/10/20/ybn-cordae-2.jpg><p>Cordae was gaining fame slowly, but exactly in accordance with his high expectations. He started to think differently as he wanted to do something different that could grab massive attention. Finally, he began remixing popular songs like ‘Old N*ggas’ and ‘May Name Is’.

The mainstream media considered this a positive move towards his future as a rapper. He also got admiration from the online rap community.
