While the two characters couldn’t be any more different, that isn’t stopping some fans from hoping <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Wednesday and Enid will date</a> in the recently announced second season.</p><p data-characters=396 data-current-count=678 data-injectable=true>The character of Enid experiences tremendous character growth over the first season, going from a werewolf pup who can’t do anything but threaten people with her well-manicured claws, to the protective werewolf who saves the Nevermore Academy students from Hyde. Myers recently told Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show about going through Werewolf Boot Camp to train for her role on Wednesday.</p><p>“I’ve never done so much parkour in my life.

How she could translate anything he was signing to her is lost on us — and the actress’ ability to keep a straight face through those scenes deserves a round of applause.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Upcoming</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=669 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>This is what instantly came into my mind when I saw Emma Myers on Wednesday.
